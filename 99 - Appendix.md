### Randomness and the Concept of Dumb Luck

One might think with trained bonus, attribute bonus, and a sufficient amount of skill points allocated to a skill, one would never fail a check of a well-trained skill. Likewise, with a severe penalty and no chance to improve beyond a raw attribute increase, one would never take the chance to attempt to use an untrained class skill. But this reduces all skill checks to a simple math problem, and that is "boring".

The rolling of a d20 introduces chance, and with it tension and excitement. This game embraces the concept of Dumb Luck, and with it _Epic Failures_ and _Epic Successes_. 

Some believe that epic failures and successes are inherently unfair, that they completely invalidate all the work put into creating the perfect character build. In a sense, that is completely accurate. 

But life is unfair, and random, and sometimes amazing and / or horrible things happen and there is no reasonable explanation for it. Furthermore, "perfect" can become dull; there is no challenge if you _know_ your character will win every encounter, every test. Epic failure and success adds just enough uncertainty, just enough tension, to keep every encounter interesting.

If you or your party do not agree and would rather play without Epic Failure and Epic Success, then that is also acceptable. Not everyone has the same definition of fun. Be sure to discuss this with the Game Master and the rest of the party, ideally before it becomes a problem.
