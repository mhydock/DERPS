### Randomness and the Concept of Dumb Luck

One might think with trained bonus, attribute bonus, and a sufficient amount of skill points allocated to a skill, one would never fail a check of a well-trained skill. Likewise, with a severe penalty and no chance to improve beyond a raw attribute increase, one would never take the chance to attempt to use an untrained class skill. But this reduces all skill checks to a simple math problem, and that is "boring".

The rolling of a d20 introduces chance, and with it tension and excitement. This game embraces the concept of Dumb Luck, and with it _Epic Failures_ and _Epic Successes_. 

Some believe that epic failures and successes are inherently unfair, that they completely invalidate all the work put into creating the perfect character build. In a sense, that is completely accurate. 

But life is unfair, and random, and sometimes amazing and / or horrible things happen and there is no reasonable explanation for it. Furthermore, "perfect" can become dull; there is no challenge if you _know_ your character will win every encounter, every test. Epic failure and success adds just enough uncertainty, just enough tension, to keep every encounter interesting.

If you or your party do not agree and would rather play without Epic Failure and Epic Success, then that is also valid. Not everyone has the same definition of fun. Be sure to discuss this with your Game Master and the rest of your party, ideally before it becomes a problem.


### Is Multiclassing Worth It?

While multiclassing is not explicitly discouraged, the more powerful techniques and abilities available to a class are usually reserved for the highest class levels; taking a level in a new class, or increasing the level of a less-learned class, could result in a character that is effectively a level "behind" the rest of the party.

That being said, some play-styles are only possible, or at least easier, with multiclassing. For instance, Bards and Rogues have techniques for befuddling enemies and moving swiftly around a battlefield. A standard Fighter that wants to be more dynamic in a fight might find it to their advantage to take a level or two in one of those classes.

In the end, whether or not multiclassing can be considered "worth it" depends on the kind of campaign being run, the enemies and scenarios encountered, the composition of the party, and more. Ultimately though, the most important thing to consider is what kind of character _you_ want to play. Maybe you'd rather be a Jack-of-all-Trades skillmonkey who can do a little bit of everything? Or maybe you'd rather be a living hammer, exceptionally good at one specific thing. As long as your Game Master agrees, and you don't cause your teammates any grief, then the choice to multiclass or not is a personal one.
