================================================================================
+ Stats based on a Mind/Body/Soul system
	- Mind
		. Intelligence	(capacity to learn)
		. Wisdom		(capacity to apply what has been learned)
		. Focus			(capacity to pay attention)
	- Body
		. Strength		(capacity to wield weapons/lift objects)
		. Dexterity		(capacity to finely manipulate objects)
		. Constitution	(capacity to withstand damage)
	- Soul
		. Faith			(capacity to believe in the unproven)
		. Charisma		(capacity to charm others)
		. Empathy		(capacity to relate emotionally)
		
+ Players distribute character points among the various attributes.
	- Each subset gets character points equal to the value of the category.
	- ex: If Mind = 10, then there are 10 points to be divided amongst INT, WIS,
		  and FOC.
	- 10 is the Human average for each superattribute.
		. At character creation, superattribute points can be redistributed
		  to the Player's liking.
		. Less than 10 points results in below average aptitude, more than
		  10 points results in above average aptitude.
		. Some species will have forced initial adjustments.
	- Every three levels the player gains a superattribute point to be
	  applied wherever they see fit.
		. Attribute points for that category will increase accordingly, and
		  will need to be distributed as well.
		. Skills/Abilities/Secondary attributes will be adjusted as well.
			
+ Magic is based on a Mana system
	- All Pathfinder spells cost (level+1)^2 Mana to use.
	- Player's total Mana pool is equal to a set formula.
		. If Player is a Wizard/Sorcerer/Summoner, Mana is (Mind*Level)
		. If Player is a Druid/Cleric/Paladin, Mana is (Soul*Level)
		. If Player is Unclassed, Mana is ((Mind+Soul)/2)*Level).
		. Mana is always calculated by levels per class.
			> If multiclassing different types (Wizard/Druid) Mana is a sum of
			  (Mind*Levels of Class A) and (Soul*Levels of Class B)
			> If multiclassing similar types, total level will suffice.
		. Rogues/Rangers/Fighters/Barbarians/Bards/Monks don't have Mana.
			> Remedied through Mana-less skills and abilities.
			> If an Unclassed later takes levels in a Mana-less class, they will
			  retain their Mana, and all spells they have learned.
	- All spells are learnable by every magic-wielding class, but class spells
	  have higher success rates when used by their class, or with a sufficiently
	  high ability score.
		. ex: A Wizard can learn and use a Holy (Faith-based) spell, but if his
		  Faith score isn't high enough, it will likely fail.
		. ex: An Unclassed can learn and use a Wizard (INT-based) spell, but
		  without the added proficiency of a Wizard class, it might fail.

+ Classes are divided into Mana-based and Skill-based
	- Mana-based
		. Wizard		(Mind*Level)
		. Sorcerer		(Mind*Level)
		. Summoner		(Mind*Level)
		. Druid			(Soul*Level)
		. Cleric		(Soul*Level)
		. Paladin		(Soul*Level)
	- Skill-based
		. Rogue			(Mind)
		. Ranger		(Mind)
		. Fighter		(Body)
		. Barbarian		(Body)
		. Bard			(Soul)
		. Monk			(Soul)
	- All Players pick up skills ("feats" in D&D) every other level.
		. Skill-based Classes have additional Class Skills.
		. Some Class Skills can be chosen by multiple different classes.
		. Every fourth level, the player can pick up a Class Skill.
	- Unclassed is a special status.
		. They have Mana, but no proficiency in any class of magic.
		. Due to their lack of commitment, any deficiency in Mind or Soul will
		  affect their ability to cast magic.
		. They do not have access to Class Skills, but every fouth level can
		  pick up another non-Class skill to compensate.
		. If a character has already picked a class, they cannot gain levels in
		  Unclassed.
		. An Unclassed can however pick up levels in other classes, and still
		  maintain levels in Unclassed.
			> This allows players to create unusual characters, like a Rogue
			  that can perform minor magic, or a Cleric with additional combat
			  skills.
			> Unclassed is treated like a different type when calculating Mana.
