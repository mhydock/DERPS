# Introduction to Role-Playing Games

For those unfamiliar with tabletop roleplaying games, the main conceit is for each player to craft their own characters, according to established rules and guides, and for a designated narrator, usually referred to as the _Dungeon Master_ or _Game Master_, to weave an adventure for the players' characters. Games are usually run as _Sessions_, which may be a one-off adventure, part of a larger _Campaign_, or even part of an _Epic_. It's a fairly free-form, collaborative, creative exercise, where everyone has a chance to build the world and tell their story.

In a session, the players can be given any number of opportunities to interact with the world. These interactions can range from engaging in peaceful negotiations to staging coups, haggling for wares at a market to making your own equipment, running from the law to being the law, and so on and so forth. In general, if there are established rules for an action the action can be performed, and if there aren't established rules for an action the Game Master has the authority to make their own rules. The Game Master also has the right to ignore or modify the rules in this text, provided the other players agree to the changes.

# Creating Your Character

Before creating your character, you and your Game Master must agree on whether the game will be using the _Basic_ or _Advanced_ ruleset. The rulesets are largely the same, but the _Advanced_ ruleset requires more math and bookkeeping, so for players who prefer to do less math and don't like taking notes, the _Basic_ ruleset might be preferred. Throughout the rest of this text, the _Basic_ ruleset will be assumed, with _Advanced_ variant rules mentioned in asides.

A character at its core requires three things: base attributes, a race, and a class. Optionally, if players are interested in the concept of "Alignment" then they may choose this during creation as well. Everything else, a character's appearance, gender, backstory, etc. are all for flavor and have little to no mechanical bearing on the playing of the character.

It should be noted that there is no explicit required combination of attributes, race, and class. An orc can be a paladin, a fighter can have cripplingly-low strength; the only thing that matters is what do _you_ the player want to play. Some classes have suggestions for base attributes, to make playing them easier, but in the end, they are but suggestions, and you are free to ignore them. The only time this is not the case is when multiclassing, which may require an attribute to be of a certain level before a second or more class can be obtained. Multiclassing will be explained in detail later on.

## Base Attributes

All characters are defined by three core attributes: their _Body_, their _Mind_, and their _Soul_.
* The _Body_ attribute affects one's proficiency in combat, athletic abilities, endurance, health; in short, all physically-oriented attributes are derived from _Body_. If you're building a character with a heavy focus on combat, whether melee or ranged, this is the attribute to pay attention to.
* The _Mind_, on the other hand, governs all mental attributes and abilities, such as one's mental fortitude, their capacity to learn new things, and their ability to focus under stress, in addition to other particulars, like magic use. Naturally, this is the most important attribute for spellcasters, like wizards, sorcerers, and summoners.
* The last attribute, the _Soul_ attribute, is easily overlooked, as it is the attribute that governs one's connection to deities and to other people and creatures; it is your character's "heart", and unless you are playing a priest, bard, or druid, it can appear useless. What's oft forgotten is that a little charisma or empathy can go a long way in negotiations, making this a vital attribute for diplomatic characters.

> **Advanced Attributes**
> 
> In the advanced ruleset, the attributes are a bit more granular, but still fall under the categories of Body, Mind, and Soul. The following is a general idea of what these granular attributes might be used for:
> * Body
>   * Strength - melee combat attribute, lift capacity
>   * Dexterity - ranged combat attribute, sleight of hand
>   * Constitution - maximum health, resistance to poison
> * Mind
>   * Wisdom - magic attribute, passive perception
>   * Intelligence - languages, book knowledge
>   * Focus - combat casting, general attribute enhancer
> * Soul
>   * Faith - magic attribute, communing with spirits
>   * Charisma - persuasion, performance, diplomacy
>   * Empathy - handling animals, sensing motives
