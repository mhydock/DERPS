# DERPS - the Dungeon Exploration and Role-Playing System

DERPS is a homebrew tabletop system blending aspects of various d20 systems, with inspiration taken from other, more simulation-oriented systems. The ultimate goal is to create a system that can be used comfortably in tabletop games but also in video games. The primary focus of this repository is to establish the core rules, and to draft a core set of character classes, races, equipment, and monsters.

The primary author of this system is M Matthew Hydock. All
