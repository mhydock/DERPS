### DERPS
==============

DERPS, or Dungeon Exploration and Role-Playing System, is a homebrew tabletop
system blending aspects of Pathfinder (think D&D 3.5) and GIRPS, with a couple
random features thrown in for good measure. It is in very early prototype stage,
and should probably not be used unless for testing purposes. Actually, it
should probably not be used, ever. Seriously, it's terrible.

Within this repository is all documentation relevent to the system that is not
currently under a strict, proprietary license. More will be added as rules are
adopted/rewritten, with the eventual goal being the creation of a slim, digital,
and complete rulebook, free for use by the public.

Authors of this system include the repository's owner, M Matthew Hydock, and his
group of pitiable guinea pigs in the DERPS Testing and Development Team. All
