DERPS
=====
---

DERPS, or Dungeon Exploration and Role-Playing System, is a homebrew tabletop
system blending aspects of Pathfinder (think D&D 3.5) and GURPS, with numerous
new concepts and additions. The ultimate goal is to create a tabletop system
with great versatility and reusability; the first modules though, in keeping
with the D&D/Pathfinder origin of this project, will be traditional Fantasy.

This project is in very early prototype stage, and should probably not be used
unless for testing purposes. Actually, it should probably not be used, ever.
Seriously, it's terrible.

Within this repository is all documentation relevent to the system that is not
currently under a strict, proprietary license. More will be added as rules are
adopted/rewritten, eventually culminating in the creation of a slim, digital,
and complete rulebook, free for use by the public.

Authors of this system include the repository's owner, M Matthew Hydock, and his
group of pitiable guinea pigs in the DERPS Testing and Development Team. All
