# Introduction to Role-Playing Games

For those unfamiliar with tabletop roleplaying games, the main conceit is for each player to craft their own characters, according to established rules and guides, and for a designated narrator, usually referred to as the _Dungeon Master_ or _Game Master_, to weave an adventure for the players' characters. Games are usually run as _Sessions_, which may be a one-off adventure, part of a larger _Campaign_, or even part of an _Epic_. It is a fairly free-form, collaborative, creative exercise, where everyone has a chance to build the world and tell their story.

In a session, the players can be given any number of opportunities to interact with the world. These interactions can range from engaging in peaceful negotiations to staging coups, haggling for wares at a market to making your own equipment, running from the law to being the law, and so on and so forth. In general, if there are established rules for an action the action can be performed, and if there are not established rules for an action the Game Master has the authority to make their own rules. The Game Master also has the right to ignore or modify the rules in this text, provided the other players agree to the changes.

# Creating Your Character

Before creating your character, you and your Game Master must agree on whether the game will be using the _Basic_ or _Advanced_ ruleset. The rulesets are largely the same, but the _Advanced_ ruleset requires more math and bookkeeping, so for players who prefer to do less math and do not like taking notes, the _Basic_ ruleset might be preferred. Throughout the rest of this text, the _Basic_ ruleset will be assumed, with _Advanced_ variant rules mentioned in asides.

A character at its core requires three things: base attributes, a race, and a class. Optionally, if players are interested in the concept of "Alignment" then they may choose this during creation as well. Everything else, a character's appearance, gender, backstory, etc. are all for flavor and have little to no mechanical bearing on the playing of the character.

It should be noted that there is no explicit required combination of attributes, race, and class. An orc can be a paladin, a fighter can have cripplingly-low strength; the only thing that matters is what do _you_ the player want to play. Some classes have suggestions for base attributes, to make playing them easier, but in the end, they are but suggestions, and you are free to ignore them. The only time this is not the case is when multiclassing, which may require an attribute to be of a certain level before a second or more class can be obtained. Multiclassing will be explained in detail later on.

## Base Attributes

All characters are defined by three core attributes: their _Body_, their _Mind_, and their _Soul_.
* The _Body_ attribute affects one's proficiency in combat, athletic abilities, endurance, health; in short, all physically-oriented attributes are derived from _Body_. If you are building a character with a heavy focus on combat, whether melee or ranged, this is the attribute to pay attention to.
* The _Mind_, on the other hand, governs all mental attributes and abilities, such as one's mental fortitude, their capacity to learn new things, and their ability to focus under stress, in addition to other particulars, like magic use. Naturally, this is the most important attribute for spellcasters, like wizards, sorcerers, and summoners.
* The last attribute, the _Soul_ attribute, is the attribute that determines one's connection to deities and to other people and creatures; it is your character's "heart", and is essential if you are playing a priest, bard, or druid. If playing other classes, it may appear useless, but what is oft forgotten is that a little charisma or empathy can go a long way in negotiations, making this a vital attribute for diplomatic characters.

> **Advanced Attributes**
> 
> In the advanced ruleset, the attributes are a bit more granular, but still fall under the categories of Body, Mind, and Soul. The following is a general idea of what these granular attributes might be used for:
> * Body
>   * Strength - melee combat, lift capacity
>   * Dexterity - ranged combat, sleight of hand
>   * Constitution - maximum health, poison resistance
> * Mind
>   * Wisdom - wild magic, passive perception
>   * Intelligence - languages, book knowledge
>   * Focus - combat casting, attribute enhancer
> * Soul
>   * Faith - divine magic, communing with spirits
>   * Charisma - persuasion, performance, diplomacy
>   * Empathy - handling animals, sensing motives

### Attribute Scores and Modifiers

Each attribute has an _Attribute Score_ and an _Attribute Modifier_ attached to it. An Attribute Score is defined at character generation, and can be increased during character progression. A score of 10 represents the statistical average level for any given attribute for a character. An Attribute Modifier is derived from the Attribute Score, and is simply the score minus 10.

Note that it is perfectly acceptable for a character, playable or otherwise, to be "lacking" in an attribute, and thus have a score under 10. Not all scores need to be above 10 for a character to be a viable adventurer.

Attribute Scores are determined primarily by two values: a _Base Score_ and a _Racial Modifier_. Additionally, some items and abilities may temporarily increase your Attribute Score; this value is a _Temporary Modifier_. The total Attribute Score then is the sum of these constituent parts. While the Temporary Modifier frequently changes, the Base Score and the Racial Modifier are usually static.

Generating the Base Score of an attribute can be performed in multiple ways. Below are a couple examples:

#### Point Buy Method

Each attribute starts at 10. The player is granted 3 points (6 if playing with advanced attributes) to allocate however they want. Furthermore, the player may take points from any attribute and move it to another. No score may be less than 7, nor higher than 13. For generating peasants or non-adventurers, do not give the character the 3 (or 6) bonus points.

#### Dice Roll Method

For each attribute the player rolls two ten-sided dice (d10), takes the higher value, and adds 5. No score may be less than 7, nor higher than 13. For generating peasants or non-adventurers, the die with the lower value is used.

## Race

A character's race is their species, subspecies, breed, etc. Race can impart certain bonuses and penalties based on their anatomical morphology. Examples include a negative modifier to strength for diminutive races, or a positive modifier to wisdom for long-lived races. Some races are hybrids of other races, and as such may benefit or suffer from positive and negative modifiers from both of their parents.

Aside from simple mechanical differences, races can also provide flavor and substance to a narrative. For instance, a sentient automata may be a curiosity, if not a minor celebrity, in a village of gnome engineers, but be ostracized and loathed in a commune of elvish druids. It is a good idea to discuss your character's race with your Game Master before you begin your campaign, to ensure that your character's race suits the setting, and to establish expectations.

> **Race vs Culture**
>
> Race and culture are _not_ synonymous; depending on setting, there _may_ be a history of beings of a certain race having, or being perceived to have, a certain culture, but this is not universal nor guaranteed. Furthermore, the larger a population the greater its chances of diversifying, especially as it fragments and/or takes in those of other cultures. The same race can easily contain communities known for their all-encompassing love and acceptance, and others feared for their extreme violence and xenophobia.
>
> This text includes examples of playable races, ethnic/regional variants, common stereotypes associated with and historical observations of those races/ethnicities, and suggestions for subverting these stereotypes. What this text _does not_ contain is a dialog on the sociological impact of the concept of race on fiction and reality. Better authors and thinkers have already addressed these issues, and it is left to the player to seek out these arguments and analyses.

## Class

A class represents a character's training and expertise, less a job and more of a career path or a trade. The skills, techniques, abilities, and knowledge associated with a class are developed or earned through hard work and experience. Many weapons, armors, and tools, and most magics, _require_ that one have experience in an appropriate class before they can make effective use of the item or spell.

Choosing your starting class is a very important decision, and poor coordination between party members when selecting character classes can result in an unbalanced and ineffective party. Be sure to consider both the campaign setting and the class choices of your fellow players if you wish to improve your chances of building an effective character.

> **Multiclassing**
>
> While focusing on progressing with a single class often offers the simplest path to strength and competence, sometimes it results in a stunted character with limited utility. Branching out into a different class can grant flexibility in play style, and can create a character far more powerful than one restricted to the abilities and techniques of a single class.
>
> In order to multiclass, when a character has reached the agreed-upon criteria to advance in character level, they may choose to gain a level in a new class, provided they meet that class's multiclass criteria (usually base attributes above a specified minimum).
>
> When calculating derived attributes like Health, Mana, and Technique points, the values for the individual classes are calculated for each class according to their level, and then summed. These attributes and their roles will be discussed in a later section.

## Skills

Skills represent the mundane abilities of an average adventurer, such as swimming, climbing, or lock picking, or in some cases more vague aspects of their capability, like grace, athleticism, or speechcraft. Some classes come with training in certain skills, which imparts a bonus during skill challenges. 

While many skills can be used untrained, some require experience in a specific class to properly utilize them; a severe penalty will be applied if a character attempts to rely on an untrained skill that requires training.

In addition to trained/untrained status, skills can also be allocated _Skill Points_ during character progression. The total number of Skill Points a character can allocate is determined by the level of their class, multiplied by a specific attribute for that class. For multiclassed characters, the total is simply the sum of the Skill Points per class. Skills that require a class cannot be allocated points if the character is not trained in that class.

The following table is a list of all skills, their class requirement, and the associated attributes (both Basic and Advanced).

| Skill           | Class | Attr (Basic) | Attr (Adv) |
|:----------------|:-----:|:------------:|:----------:|

### Knowledge

Additionally, a character may have _Knowledge_ of various subjects, usually acquired through the course of their training or prior adventures. Knowledge acts similarly to regular skills, except for the fact that they all require training in a specific class.

| Knowledge        | Attr (Basic) | Attr (Adv) |
|:-----------------|:------------:|:----------:|
| Dungeoneering    |     Mind     |     WIS    |
| Engineering      |     Mind     |     INT    |
| Global           |     Mind     |     INT    |
| Local            |     Mind     |     WIS    |
| Linguistics      |     Mind     |     INT    |

Descriptions of the nature and uses of these different fields of knowledge will be found later in this text.

### Skill Challenges

Throughout the course of an adventure it is likely for a player to be presented with a _Skill Challenge_. This is an event whereby the character needs to rely on a skill to perform a certain action. These challenges pit a known _Challenge Rating_ against the character's aptitude with a related skill, plus a random value generated by the roll of a 20-sided die.

> **Passive Skills**
>
> Some skills can be used passively. With these skills, if they are declared to be performed passively, a d20 is not needed, and a flat value of 10 is substituted instead. Allocated points are not considered, but class bonus is.
> 
> Skills that can be used passively include:
> * Convince
> * Perception
> * Knowledge
> 
> and any other skill that makes sense for the character's background (e.g. Stealth, Perform).

Below is a possible scenario, involving both untrained skill use and a passive skill:

> * Thog the Barbarian needs to sneak past a guard, lest he draw the attention of the entire fort.
> * Thog is not trained in sneaking, because barbarians do not usually sneak.
> * Sneaking is a skill that can be used untrained though, as conceptually, sneaking is not that difficult.
> * As such, Thog may attempt to sneak, relying on his Body (DEX) score, along with whatever points have been allocated to his Stealth skill during the course of character progression.
> * Thog's player rolls a d20, and adds the result to Thog's Stealth score.
> * If the total is greater than the guard's passive perception, Thog succeeds, otherwise Thog fails.

> **Trained vs. Untrained vs. Class Skills**
> 
> As mentioned previously, training with a particular skill will impart a bonus during skill challenges, while attempting to perform a skill that requires class training without training in said class will incur a penalty. The bonus for a trained skill is **+3** while the penalty for an untrained class skill is **-10**.

### Epic Success and Failure

_Epic Success_ and _Epic Failure_ grant a character the opportunity to succeed at tasks they're normally not capable of performing, while also introducing the possibility of failure for a character who is expertly trained at a task.

An _Epic Failure_ is a roll of 1 on a d20, and represents accidents, lapses in judgement, or divine punishment, and results in an immediate failure of the intended action, regardless of total point value.

An _Epic Success_ is a roll of 20 on a d20, and represents beginner's luck, a flash of intuition, or divine intervention, and results in an immediate success of the intended action, regardless of total point value.

While epic success and failure have the potential to make a game more exciting, some might consider the rule makes the game more frustrating. Justifications for including epic success and failure are included in the Appendix, but if the players disagree, they are welcome to ignore them.

# Character Progression

The primary method by which a character can become stronger is by increasing their competence in one or more classes. A character's competence in their class is represented by their Class Level, which is increased after reaching certain milestones. These milestones can be reached through various means, such as by acquiring a set amount of experience points, if playing a game that uses experience points, or by GM fiat, such as after certain difficult battles, the conclusion of important scenarios, or in-game passage of time.

When a character reaches a level milestone, the player has the option to increase the level of a class they are already proficient in, or begin learning a new class, if they meet that class's prerequisites. By improving a known class, or acquiring a new one, a character may learn new abilities specific to that class. The sum of the levels of a character's known classes is the character's Player Level, or Character Level for NPCs. 

In addition to class abilities, gaining levels also has the chance to improve the character's attributes. If playing by Basic rules, an attribute point is earned every four Player Levels, to spend on any basic attribute. If playing by Advanced rules, an attribute point is earned every other Player Level to spend on any advanced attribute. Upon increasing an attribute, all skills and other character stats based on that attribute will improve accordingly.

After updating attributes, it's time to allocate skill points, as described in the previous section on Skills. If the player has acquired a new class, and that class comes with training in skills the player did not know before, then these should also be marked and their scores updated.

The last stats to be updated are Health, Stamina, and Mana/Tech. The function of these stats will be explained in greater depth later. Below is a table showing the values involved in determining these stats:

| Stat      | Base | Lvl Multi. | Die | Attr Mod (Basic) | Attr Mod (Adv) |
|-----------|------|------------|-----|------------------|----------------|
| Health    | 10   | 1x         | d12 | Body             | CON            |
| Stamina   | 5    | 0.5x       | d6  | Body             | CON            |
| Mana/Tech | 10   | 1x         | d8  | Class dep.       | Class dep.     |

To calculate the final values, the general formula is: 
> Base + Lvl Multi * Player Level * Attr Mod + Player Level # Die Rolls

If the Attribute Modifier is negative, then this value is subtracted instead of added. These stats may not be lower than their Base values. If the player is not interested in taking chances, instead of rolling dice they may take half the max value of the relevant die (i.e. d12 -> 6, d8 -> 4, d6 -> 3). The Attribute Modifier for Mana and Tech points is determined by classes, and the stat's score will only increase on Class Level increases, instead of Player Level increases; the same multiplier applies.
