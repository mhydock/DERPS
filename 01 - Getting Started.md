# Introduction to Role-Playing Games

For those unfamiliar with tabletop roleplaying games, the main conceit is for each player to craft their own characters, according to established rules and guides, and for a designated narrator, usually referred to as the _Dungeon Master_ or _Game Master_, to weave an adventure for the players' characters. Games are usually run as _Sessions_, which may be a one-off adventure, part of a larger _Campaign_, or even part of an _Epic_. It is a fairly free-form, collaborative, creative exercise, where everyone has a chance to build the world and tell their story.

In a session, the players can be given any number of opportunities to interact with the world. These interactions can range from engaging in peaceful negotiations to staging coups, haggling for wares at a market to making your own equipment, running from the law to being the law, and so on and so forth. In general, if there are established rules for an action the action can be performed, and if there are not established rules for an action the Game Master has the authority to make their own rules. The Game Master also has the right to ignore or modify the rules in this text, provided the other players agree to the changes.

# Creating Your Character

Before creating your character, you and your Game Master must agree on whether the game will be using the _Basic_ or _Advanced_ ruleset. The rulesets are largely the same, but the _Advanced_ ruleset requires more math and bookkeeping, so for players who prefer to do less math and do not like taking notes, the _Basic_ ruleset might be preferred. Throughout the rest of this text, the _Basic_ ruleset will be assumed, with _Advanced_ variant rules mentioned in asides.

A character at its core requires three things: base attributes, a race, and a class. Optionally, if players are interested in the concept of "Alignment" then they may choose this during creation as well. Everything else, a character's appearance, gender, backstory, etc. are all for flavor and have little to no mechanical bearing on the playing of the character.

It should be noted that there is no explicit required combination of attributes, race, and class. An orc can be a paladin, a fighter can have cripplingly-low strength; the only thing that matters is what do _you_ the player want to play. Some classes have suggestions for base attributes, to make playing them easier, but in the end, they are but suggestions, and you are free to ignore them. The only time this is not the case is when multiclassing, which may require an attribute to be of a certain level before a second or more class can be obtained. Multiclassing will be explained in detail later on.

## Base Attributes

All characters are defined by three core attributes: their _Body_, their _Mind_, and their _Soul_.
* The _Body_ attribute affects one's proficiency in combat, athletic abilities, endurance, health; in short, all physically-oriented attributes are derived from _Body_. If you are building a character with a heavy focus on combat, whether melee or ranged, this is the attribute to pay attention to.
* The _Mind_, on the other hand, governs all mental attributes and abilities, such as one's mental fortitude, their capacity to learn new things, and their ability to focus under stress, in addition to other particulars, like magic use. Naturally, this is the most important attribute for spellcasters, like wizards, sorcerers, and summoners.
* The last attribute, the _Soul_ attribute, is easily overlooked, as it is the attribute that governs one's connection to deities and to other people and creatures; it is your character's "heart", and unless you are playing a priest, bard, or druid, it can appear useless. What is oft forgotten is that a little charisma or empathy can go a long way in negotiations, making this a vital attribute for diplomatic characters.

> **Advanced Attributes**
> 
> In the advanced ruleset, the attributes are a bit more granular, but still fall under the categories of Body, Mind, and Soul. The following is a general idea of what these granular attributes might be used for:
> * Body
>   * Strength - melee combat, lift capacity
>   * Dexterity - ranged combat, sleight of hand
>   * Constitution - maximum health, poison resistance
> * Mind
>   * Wisdom - wild magic, passive perception
>   * Intelligence - languages, book knowledge
>   * Focus - combat casting, attribute enhancer
> * Soul
>   * Faith - divine magic, communing with spirits
>   * Charisma - persuasion, performance, diplomacy
>   * Empathy - handling animals, sensing motives

### Ability Scores and Modifiers

Each attribute has an _Ability Score_ and an _Ability Modifier_ attached to it. An Ability Score is defined at character generation, and can be increased during character progression. A score of 10 represents the statistical average level for any given attribute for a character. An Ability Modifier is derived from the Ability Score, and is simply the score minus 10.

Note that it is perfectly acceptable for a character, playable or otherwise, to be "deficient" in an attribute, and thus have a score under 10. Not all scores need to be above 10 for a character to be a viable adventurer.

Ability Scores are determined primarily by two values: a _Base Score_ and a _Racial Modifier_. Additionally, some items and abilities may temporarily increase your Ability Score; this value is a _Temporary Modifier_. The total Ability Score then is the sum of these constituent parts. While the Temporary Modifier frequently changes, the Base Score and the Racial Modifier are usually static.

Generating the Base Score of an attribute can be performed in multiple ways. Below are a couple examples:

#### Point Buy Method

Each attribute starts at 10. The player is granted three points to allocate however they want. Furthermore, the player may take points from any attribute and move it to another. No score may be less than 7, nor higher than 13. For generating peasants or non-adventurers, do not give the character the three bonus points.

#### Dice Roll Method

For each attribute the player rolls two ten-sided dice (d10), takes the higher value, and adds 5. No score may be less than 7, nor higher than 13. For generating peasants or non-adventurers, the die with the lower value is used.

## Race

A character's race is their species, subspecies, breed, etc. Race can impart certain bonuses and penalties based on their physical and social structure. Examples include a negative modifier to strength for diminutive races, or a positive modifier to wisdom for long-lived races. Some races are hybrids of other races, and as such may benefit or suffer from positive and negative modifiers from both of their parents.

Aside from simple mechanical differences, races can also provide flavor and substance to a narrative. For instance, a sentient automata may be a curiosity, if not a minor celebrity, in a village of gnome engineers, but be ostracized and loathed in a commune of elvish druids. It is a good idea to discuss your character's race with your Game Master before you begin your campaign, to ensure that your character's race suits the setting, and to establish expectations.

## Class

A class represents a character's training and expertise, less a job and more of a career path or a trade. The skills, techniques, abilities, and knowledge associated with a class are developed or earned through hard work and experience. Many weapons, armors, and tools, and most magics, _require_ that one have experience in an appropriate class before they can make effective use of the item or spell.

Choosing your starting class is a very important decision, and poor coordination between party members when selecting character classes can result in an unbalanced and ineffective party. Be sure to consider both the campaign setting and the class choices of your fellow players if you wish to improve your chances of building an effective character.

> **Multiclassing**
>
> While focusing on progressing with a single class often offers the simplest path to strength and competence, sometimes it results in a stunted character with limited utility. Branching out into a different class can grant flexibility in play style, and can create a character far more powerful than one restricted to the abilities and techniques of a single class.
>
> In order to multiclass, when a character has reached the agreed-upon criteria to advance in character level, they may choose to gain a level in a new class, provided they meet that class's multiclass criteria (usually base attributes above a specified minimum).
>
> When calculating derived attributes like Health, Mana, and Technique points, the values for the individual classes are calculated for each class according to their level, and then summed. These attributes and their roles will be discussed in a later section.

## Skills

Skills represent the mundane abilities of an average adventurer, such as swimming, climbing, or lock picking, or in some cases more vague aspects of their capability, like grace, athleticism, or speechcraft. Some classes come with training in certain skills, which imparts a bonus during skill challenges. 

While many skills can be used untrained, some require experience in a specific class to properly utilize them; a severe penalty will be applied if a character attempts to rely on an untrained skill that requires training.

In addition to trained/untrained status, skills can also be allocated _Skill Points_ during character progression. The total number of Skill Points a character can allocate is determined by the level of their class, multiplied by a specific attribute for that class. For multiclassed characters, the total is simply the sum of the Skill Points per class. Skills that require a class cannot be allocated points if the character is not trained in that class.

The following table is a list of all skills, their class requirement, and the associated attributes (both Basic and Advanced).

### Knowledge

Additionally, a character may have Knowledge of various subjects, usually acquired through the course of their training or prior adventures. Knowledge acts similarly to
regular skills, except for the fact that they all require
training in a specific class.

| Knowledge        | Attr (Basic) | Attr (Adv) |
|:----------------:|:------------:|:----------:|
| Dungeoneering    |     Mind     |     WIS    |

Descriptions of the nature and uses of these different fields of knowledge will be found later in this text.

### Skill Challenges

Throughout the course of an adventure it is likely for a player to be presented with a _Skill Challenge_. This is an event whereby the character needs to rely on a skill to perform a certain action. These challenges pit a known _Challenge Rating_ against the character's aptitude with a related skill, plus a random value generated by the roll of a 20-sided die.

> **Passive Skills**
>
> Some skills can be used passively. With these skills, if they are declared to be performed passively, a d20 is not needed, and a flat value of 10 is substituted instead. Allocated points are not considered, but class bonus is.
> 
> Skills that can be used passively include:
> * Convince
> * Perception
> * Knowledge
> 
> and any other skill that makes sense for the character's background (e.g. Stealth, Perform).

Below is a possible scenario, involving both untrained skill use and a passive skill:

> * Thog the Barbarian needs to sneak past a guard, lest he draw the attention of the entire fort.
> * Thog is not trained in sneaking, because barbarians do not usually sneak.
> * Sneaking is a skill that can be used untrained though, as conceptually, sneaking is not that difficult.
> * As such, Thog may attempt to sneak, relying on his Body (DEX) score, along with whatever points have been allocated to his Stealth skill during the course of character progression.
> * Thog's player rolls a d20, and adds the result to Thog's Stealth score.
> * If the total is greater than the guard's passive perception, Thog succeeds, otherwise Thog fails.

> **Trained vs. Untrained vs. Class Skills**
> 
> As mentioned previously, training with a particular skill will impart a bonus during skill challenges, while attempting to perform a skill that requires class training without training in said class will incur a penalty. The bonus for a trained skill is **+3** while the penalty for an untrained class skill is **-10**.

### Randomness and the Concept of Dumb Luck

One might think with trained bonus, attribute bonus, and a sufficient amount of skill points allocated to a skill, one would never fail a check of a well-trained skill. Likewise, with a severe penalty and no chance to improve beyond a raw attribute increase, one would never take the chance to attempt to use an untrained class skill. But this reduces all skill checks to a simple math problem, and that is "boring".

The rolling of a d20 introduces chance, and with it tension and excitement. This game embraces the concept of Dumb Luck, and with it _Epic Failures_ and _Epic Successes_. 

An _Epic Failure_ is a roll of 1 on a d20, and represents accidents, lapses in judgement, or divine punishment, and results in an immediate failure of the intended action, regardless of total point value.

An _Epic Success_ is a roll of 20 on a d20, and represents beginner's luck, a flash of intuition, or divine intervention, and results in an immediate success of the intended action, regardless of total point value.

Some believe that epic failures and successes are inherently unfair, that they completely invalidate all the work put into creating the perfect character build. In a sense, that is completely accurate. 

But life is unfair, and random, and sometimes amazing and / or horrible things happen and there is no reasonable explanation for it. Furthermore, "perfect" can become dull; there is no challenge if you _know_ your character will win every encounter, every test. Epic failure and success adds just enough uncertainty, just enough tension, to keep every encounter interesting.

If you or your party do not agree and would rather play without Epic Failure and Epic Success, then that is also acceptable. Not everyone has the same definition of fun. Be sure to discuss this with the Game Master and the rest of the party, ideally before it becomes a problem.

# Character Progression

If playing by Basic rules, a point is earned every four levels, to spend on any basic attribute. If playing by Advanced rules, a point is earned every other level to spend on any advanced attribute.
